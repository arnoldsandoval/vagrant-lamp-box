# vagrant-lamp-box
A simple LAMP vagrant instance. There are many like it, but this is mine.

## Getting Started
Getting started is super simple.

1. If you havent already, [install Vagrant](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/installation/)
2. Then provision (create & configure) the box by running: ```vagrant up --provision```
3. Thats it! You should be able to access the box in your browser by going to ```http://localhost:4567/html/```

## TODO
- Create a database and way to add seed data as part of provisioning
